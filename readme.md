This repository documents my complete learning journey in C programming, starting from basics and gradually moving to advanced concepts.

I created this repo to:

Strengthen my fundamentals in C

Practice problem-solving

Build a strong base for Data Structures & Algorithms

Track my progress over time

Each folder represents a stage of learning, with simple explanations and well-commented code.
